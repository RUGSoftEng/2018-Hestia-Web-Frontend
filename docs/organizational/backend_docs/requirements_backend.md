## Introduction
This document is for our own organizational purposes, so we know what to do and how to do it, regarding the remote server that will allow users to access their local controller from anywhere.

### Critical Requirements
* Choose a scalable web server platform, with an accompanying database application.
* Have a global database of registered users that can be used for authentication on web and IOS.
* Be able to link multiple controllers to a single user, or multiple users to a single controller.
* Follow REST principles at all costs.
